Object Tracking:

Short-term, model-free visual object tracking is the problem of continuously localizing a target in a video sequence given a single example of its appearance

The standard formulation of DCF uses circular correlation which allows to implement learning efficiently by Fast Fourier transform (FFT)

Bolme et al (2010) (== MOSSE, based on DCF)
MOSSE = minimum output sum of squared error
uses grayscale template
uses least squares to optimize best filter (H_*) for given training images (f_i) and training outputs (g_i)
f_i is training image (target)
g_i is a gaussian with some sigma, and peak at the center of target
h is such that f_i ** h = g_i in convolution sense
in fourier domain, F_i .* H_* = G_i (element wise multiply)
Optimization for all images : H = argmin(H) sigma_sum(i) L2(F_i .* H_* - G_i)
Goal is to find the filter H that minimizes sum of squared output error.
Since this is elementwise multiplication, each element in H can be optimized independently.
H_wv = argmin(H_wv) sigma_sum(i) L2(F_iwv .* H_*_wv - G_iwv); where w,v index the elements of H
(derivation of closed-form solution in Appendix A of the paper)

DCF improvements:

In the first group, [Add features]
- Henriques et al (2015) [KCF] replaced the grayscale templates by HoG (Dalal and Triggs, 2005), 
- Danelljan et al (2014b) proposed multi-dimensional color attributes and 
- Li and Zhu (2014b) applied feature combination. 
- Recently, convolutional network features learned for object detection have been applied (Ma et al, 2015; Danelljan et al, 2015b, 2016), leading to a performance boost, but at a cost of significant speed reduction.

Conceptually, [improvements in filter learning]
- the first successful theoretical extension of the standard DCF was the kernelized formulation by Henriques et al (2015) which achieved remarkable tracking performance, but still preserved high speed. 
- Later, a  correlation filter based scale adaptation was proposed by Danelljan et al (2014a) introduced a scale-space pyramid learned within a correlation filter framework. 
- Zhang et al (2014) introduced spatio-temporal context learning in the DCFs. 
- To improve localization with correlation filters, Bertinetto et al (2016a) proposed a tracking method that combines the output of the correlation filter with the target segmentation probability map. 
- Danelljan et al (2016) addressed a multiple-resolution feature map issue in correlation filters by formulating filter learning in continuous space, while 
- Qi et al (2016) proposed a mechanism to combine correlation responses from multiple convolutional layers. 
- A correlation filter tracker which is able to handle drifts in longer sequences was proposed by Wang et al (2016). It clusters similar target appearances together and uses the clusters for target localization instead of a single online learned filter

Window/Spatial problems (filter being limited to target size) were solved 
- by Kiani Galoogahi et al (2015) who propose zero-padding the filter during learning, and 
- by Danelljan et al (2015a) who introduce spatial regularization to penalize filter values outside the target boundaries
